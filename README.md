# Url Shortener

A url shortener is designed to reduce the length of urls which are often too long. This project aims to reduce the url to replace it with a slug.
When we type the url with the slug, we are automatically redirect to the url given to create the slug.

This project uses NodeJS, Express and can be deployed on Heroku.

To start the project follow the instructions below:

```sh

$ npm install (to install all dependencies)
$ npm run dev (starts the project in dev mode using nodemon)
```

or

Then enjoy our beautiful url shortener written in NodeJS.
